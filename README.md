# Hardware Design
My Learning note for hardware design (under development). ***Books*** includes all e-books and read list when I study electrical and electronic engineering. ***Notes*** includes all learning notes when I study system engineering. <br>
<br>
Most of this part are my BEng courses lecture notes (I deleted example parts in my notes and made some modifications). If there still have some error, please cotact me.
<br><br>
It is better to download the note to read since it included some equations and figures that it may not shows correctly in github.

I'll keep updating, following is a contents of this repository:
